Hugo ships with several [Built-in Shortcodes](https://gohugo.io/content-management/shortcodes/#use-hugos-built-in-shortcodes) for rich content, along with a Privacy Config and a set of Simple Shortcodes that enable static and no-JS versions of various social media embeds.

&nbsp;

## YouTube privacy enhanced shortcode

The youtube shortcode embeds a responsive video player for YouTube videos. Only the ID of the video is required, e.g.:

_YouTube URL:_

```
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qHkcs3kG44
```

Shortcode:

```
{{</* youtube 3qHkcs3kG44 */>}}
```

Rendered output:
{{< youtube 3qHkcs3kG44 >}}
